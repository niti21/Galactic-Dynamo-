# Galactic-Dynamo-

This code simulates how a magnetic field evolves over time in a rotating disk-like system, considering various physical parameters and differential equations governing the system's behavior. A galactic dynamo refers to a theoretical mechanism responsible for the generation and maintenance of magnetic fields in galaxies and we study the interaction between magnetic fields and ionized gas within galaxies. In this project, we explore the behavior of galactic mean-field dynamos using the mean-field induction equation. This study explores the computational solution of the mean field diffusion equation for galactic dynamo under the no-z approximation, utilizing the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The objective is to investigate the evolution of magnetic field magnitude and exponential decay rate while considering various parameters and their effects on the dynamo process. The equations were solved by omitting terms involving $∇ × (V × B) $ and $α$, focusing solely on terms related to turbulent diffusivity $ηt$. Additionally, the mean-field $α-Ω $ dynamo equations were solved in the kinematic regime, incorporating the $Ω $effect and the $α $ effect. The diffusion equation's critical dynamo number was determined numerically, with emphasis on automating this process.  Our findings reveal that the initial seed field decays for dynamo numbers below the critical value and grows for those exceeding it. Notably, we observe magnetic field saturation on quenching, particularly when the vertical velocity component increases with time.
